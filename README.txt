# PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A BETA VERSION OF WHAT WILL BE THE FULL RELEASE OF THE ROBLOX SNIPER THIS IS FOR PROOF THAT THE SNIPER WORKS
Why do I need the content.txt file?
Answer: You need to keep the content.txt file because we need the roblox webpage sourcecode to get a csrf token and the id of items. Without the file the code won't work because it is to much data to store inside a variable
====
What is the custom.txt file?
Answer: The custom.txt file is if you want to purchase only certain items just provide the item url's their, and then change the "set_items" option inside config.json to "true"
==== 
What is the average time for items to be sniped?
Answer: It all really depends on the connection and the threads. The more threads the faster items will be sniped (Note: Threads take up CPU Power). On replit the average time to purchase an item is 0.5sec-1.3sec Using 1-3 threads
==== 
How do i set the config.json Options
Answer: All you need to do is change the statment in the config file for example if you set the "set_items" option to "true" it will only snipe the items in the custom.txt file, then when you set it back to false it will stop.
